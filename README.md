# datasci-healthcare_visualization
A notebook working with geospatial data as an activity for Data Science elective in DLSU

## Experience
Was really cool seeing the geospatial data actually being put in the map, especially when looking at some observations (for example, there's a lot of missing data in the amenities dataset, so it led to weird plots like the 'healthcare' amenity type only had 1 observation, and 'laboratory' only showing up in Pampanga, but not Metro Manila.
